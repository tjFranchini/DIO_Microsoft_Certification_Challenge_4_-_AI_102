The workflows involved in Machine Learning are as follows\\nChallenges in MLOps\\nLogically create, maintain the resources\\nKeep track of ML Experiments and each Runs of experiments\\n- Create, Reuse, delete environment with dependencies\\nOpting, provisioning, re-using Local/Cloud based compute\\nMaintaining different versions of Model\\nRe-using the existing ML workflows\\nDeploying and Maintaining the ML models\\nTools to perform Machine Learning in Azure\\nAzure Portal\\nAzure Machine Learning Studio (UI + Coding)\\nAzure Machine Learning Designer (Completely UI + less coding)\\nAzure CLI\\nAzure Python SDK\\nUsing Azure ML Studio\\nVisual Studio Code + AzureML Extensions\\nOther IDEs\\nArchitecture of Azure Machine Learning\\nBefore we get started...\\nPre-requisites\\nBasic Python programming Language\\nUnderstanding of Machine Learning Workflows\\nSetup\\nAzure Account with Subscription\\nCreate a Machine Learning Resource.\\nProvide a name for the workspace, Container Register\\nLaunch the Machine Learning Studio\\nCreate Compute Resource\\nOn the left side, under Manage, select Compute.\\nSelect +New to create a new compute instance.\\nKeep all the defaults on the first page, select Next.\\nSupply a name and select Create.\\nIn about two minutes, you'll see the State of the\\ncompute instance change from Creating to Running. It's now ready to go.\\nCreate Dataset\\nYou can create datasets from datastores, public URLs, and Azure Open Datasets.\\nLaunch a Notebook instance\\nYou can follow this\\ndoc\\nto create necessary Azure ML Resources\\nCreating Azure ML Resources\\nWorkspace\\nAn Azure ML Workspace is an Azure resource that organizes and coordinates the actions of many other Azure resources to assist in executing and sharing machine learning workflows. In particular, an Azure ML Workspace coordinates storage, databases, and compute resources providing added functionality for machine learning experimentation, deployment, inference, and the monitoring of deployed models.\\nYou can create/access workspace by\\nUsing Constructor\\nUsing config.json file\\nCompute\\nAll ML Experiments requires Compute to execute. To Create / Access the Compute Resource use ComputeTarget Class\\nExperiment\\nIn Azure Machine Learning, an experiment is a named process, usually the running of a script or a pipeline, that can generate metrics and outputs and be tracked in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.\\nCreate Experiment\\nAn experiment can be run multiple times, with different data, code, or settings; and Azure Machine Learning tracks each run, enabling you to view run history and compare results for each run.\\nThe Experiment Run Context\\nWhen you submit an experiment, you use its run context to initialize and end the experiment run that is tracked in Azure Machine Learning\\nYou can log, monitor every run in the experiment.\\nData\\nData\\nAny Machine Learning problems involves working with Data.\\nIt involves importing the data from the data source\\nRegistering, Maintaining the dataset in Data Store\\nVersioning the dataset. You can learn more about Datasets\\nhere\\nNow we have all the necessary resources to train, deploy and monitor ML Models.\\nStay tuned for the next blog in this series for the same.\\nAzure Machine Learning Series (3 Part Series)\\n1\\nIntroduction to Machine Learning\\n2\\nGetting started with Azure Machine Learning\\n3\\nTraining Machine Learning models in AzureML\\nTop comments\\n(0)\\nSubscribe\\nPersonal\\nTrusted User\\nCreate template\\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\\nSubmit\\nPreview\\nDismiss\\nCode of Conduct\\n•\\nReport abuse\\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?
